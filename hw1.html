<h2>My education life</h2>

    I am Deeba Raine. I have completed my high school in Afghanistan.
    After graduation, I began my TOEFL IBT prepartion journey, which led
    me to the American University of Afghanistan, which was not only 
    unpredictable but a very joyful journey for me despite the short 
    time of physically studying oppuruntiy I had there.

    after the fall of Afghanistan. A dark year for all the 40 million
    poeple of Afghanitan it was and will always be.
