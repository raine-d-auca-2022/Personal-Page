                <h3>ABOUT</h3>
                <p> I am Deeba Raine. I have completed my high school in Afghanistan.
                    After graduation, I began my TOEFL IBT prepartion journey, which led
                    me to the American University of Afghanistan, which was not only 
                    unpredictable but a very joyful journey for me despite the short 
                    time of physically studying oppuruntiy I had there. Amid my studies I was evacuated to Kyrgyzstan in october of 2021 
                    after the fall of Afghanistan. A dark year for all the 40 million
                    poeple of Afghanitan it was and will always be. Now it has been more than a year I am part of AUCA commuinty.
                    It took me some time to get adapted to the AUCA environment and feel the part of this community.
                    Fortunatley, I am fully adapted now, and I enjoy studying and being in the capmus of AUCA.
